description: I joined Bigmouth as a consultant specifically to help them develop a custom themed Wordpress website for two financial advisor clients. The primary requirement was for a quick turnaround and that the site was mobile and tablet responsive. I created the fountainhead-advisors using a agency account I setup on the Pantheon CMS hosting platform. I created the custom theme utilizing the underscore.me starter theme. I setup the development and testing environments with Git deployment and configured the live site with Varnish Cache and New Relic performance monitoring.
environment: 
  - "Pantheon Platform"
  - "Wordpress 4.5.2"
  - "HTML5"
  - "Git"
  - "SASS/Suzy"
  - "Responsive"
  - "Active"
