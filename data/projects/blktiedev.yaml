description: I was hired by the Blk Tie Dev group as a Front-End/Wordpress developer to build the enhanced story submission form and discover (search/filter) page for The Angel Island Immigration Station Foundationâ€™s Immigrant Stories website. I installed and customized several 3rd party plugins including Gravity forms, Theme My Login and Profi Search to create a user generated content submission form that allowed anyone to register for the AIISF site and tell a story of their immigrant story and provide a filterable search index of existing stories.
