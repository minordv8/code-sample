recommendation: We hired Johnny when our workload expanded quickly and we needed a hand scaling up our development team. He was able to jump into our highly complex site architecture quickly and started closing tickets faster than anyone expected. Every time we had a release due for one of our websites, Johnny would not only deliver his tasks that were scheduled for that release, but he would usually finish 1-2 extra ones that were scheduled for later ones. He greatly accelerated our production efforts, and did so very efficiently. Whenever he billed us for hours, it was always impressively fewer than I expected for his projects. Johnny is a solid all-around web developer that can quickly adapt to a new work environment and simply kick ass.
