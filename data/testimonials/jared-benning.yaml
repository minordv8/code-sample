recommendation: I worked with Johnny for around 6 months while working at a tech company in San Francisco. Johnny proved himself as a very thorough and detailed developer. Whenever we worked together on a project, I would assign the tasks and if I wasn't clear he would ask me for further details. Once he felt he understood my requests (I am not always clear on my requests), he would execute them perfectly...
relation: Jared worked directly with Johnny at Apcera
