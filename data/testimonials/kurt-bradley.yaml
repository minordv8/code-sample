recommendation: Johnny is a tenacious self-starter with a remarkable appetite for acquiring new tech/dev skills and responsibilities. He's great at juggling multiple important tasks simultaneously without losing sight of business priorities. Talent and dependability? Nothing but. Johnny's one of the most well balanced "tech-heads" I have ever worked with. If his sticktoitiveness and logic branching skills don't convince you, his karate and softball prowess definitely will. I'd work with Johnny H again in a heartbeat.
relation: Kurt managed Johnny at Perfect Escapes Inc.
