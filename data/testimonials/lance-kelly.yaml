recommendation: Johnny worked for me a second time in his career at Fanfare Entertainment. He was responsible for developing the UI on one of our music products called, Rifftime. He was a great bridge between the designers and the back-end engineers. Johnny worked hard -- even though he was part time -- and aways did what it took to get the job done on time.
